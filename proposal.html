                <p>Haan to finally ab raat se code karte karte ab subeh ka 9 12 am ho chuka hai,ye last page hai is website ka, hope you liked it
                   <br> Would you…</p>
                <p>out of all the chaos in this loud, restless world…</p>
                <p>out of all the timelines we could've been born into…</p>
                <p>out of all the random chances and coincidences that somehow led us here…</p>
                <p><strong>Would you choose me?</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>Not just for a day filled with roses and chocolates.</p>
                <p>Not just for a cute Instagram story.</p>
                <p>Not just for the 14th of February.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But for the slow mornings.</p>
                <p>For the late-night talks that turn into 3 AM confessions.</p>
                <p>For the random fights and the even more random laughter.</p>
                <p>For the "I miss you" texts.</p>
                <p>For the silent comfort.</p>
                <p>For the hand-holding in crowded places.</p>
                <p>For the small victories and the heavy days.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If I could, I'd underline your name in every chapter of my life.</p>
                <p>You are the unexpected plot twist I didn't see coming.</p>
                <p>The calm in my overthinking mind.</p>
                <p>The warmth in ordinary days.</p>
                <p>The reason songs suddenly make sense.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I don't want perfect.</p>
                <p>I don't want a fairytale filtered version of love.</p>
                <p>I want real.</p>
                <p>I want messy.</p>
                <p>I want honest.</p>
                <p>I want us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So here I am — no dramatic background music (okay maybe a little), no rehearsed speech, just me — standing in front of you with a heart that's a little nervous but very sure.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Would you let me call you mine this Valentine's Day?</p>
                <p>Would you let me be the one who makes you smile a little more?</p>
                <p>Would you let me choose you — again and again?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Because if you say yes, I promise:</p>
                <p>I'll be consistent.</p>
                <p>I'll be intentional.</p>
                <p>I'll show up.</p>
                <p>I'll make you feel chosen — not just told.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="final-question">So… Will you be my Valentine? 💌</p>
